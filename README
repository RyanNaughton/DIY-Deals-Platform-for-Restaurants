This project is a “Do-It-Yourself Deals Platform” for restaurants that allows the business to create deals for customers.  It is my current breakable toy and is unfinished, but it highlights what I learned while at Code Academy (I wrote it as my final project for demo day at Code Academy)

Each restaurant has its own subdomain, phone number, and e-mail address in order to provide a personalized experience between the business and its customers.  The restaurant can create a LivingSocial style deal, and this deal is sent to customers who subscribed for alerts via SMS and e-mail.  Additionally, it posts the deal to the restaurant’s Twitter account.  I utilized Twilio for sending/receiving the text messages and SendGrid for e-mail.  I used Omniauth for the OAuth authentication with Twitter.  The deal alerts are managed by Resque.

I wanted to more thoroughly explore AJAX, Javascript, and JQuery, so the entire site is asyncronous (i.e. there are no page loads).

My next steps are to add Presenters for different deal templates (and remove such presentation logic from the deal model), finish Stripe payment integration, and add user signup.
